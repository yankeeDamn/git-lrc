Scope: Local persistence and file system operations in the storage boundary

## Executive Summary

This document tracks storage-side operations in git-lrc as an auditable inventory for enterprise due diligence.

- Storage boundary: local file system and local SQLite only (no outbound API calls in this package).
- Modes represented: file, db.
- Operation count tracked: 39 operations.
- Severity distribution: High 10, Medium 11, Low 18.
- Primary sensitive data in scope: API keys and connector state in config, review metadata in SQLite, hook scripts and metadata, update lock/state metadata.
- Highest-risk operation classes: credential file read/write, recursive deletion, permission changes, direct SQL execution wrappers.
- Primary compensating controls already present: atomic writes for critical files, SQLite WAL mode and busy timeout, explicit chmod utility usage, typed wrapper functions and contextual error wrapping.
- High-priority updates added in this review: mode-specific permission tests, backward-compatible schema version marker note, optional dry-run/logged branch delete API, optional confirmation-gated full delete API, review-session SQL mutation routing through ExecSQL, and pending-update integrity hash validation with legacy compatibility.

## Severity Rubric

- High: operation can expose credentials, alter integrity-critical state, perform broad deletion, change permissions, or mutate persistent review/session records.
- Medium: operation mutates non-critical persisted state or reads/writes operational data that can impact behavior but is lower sensitivity.
- Low: operation creates directories, reads low-sensitivity input, or performs cleanup with limited impact.

## Risk Acknowledgement Rules

- Every operation row must state known risk and compensation status.
- High-severity rows must include explicit compensation or explicit suggestion marker.
- Suggestion marker format: Suggestion: <compensation>
- Acceptable residual risk must be called out when controls are considered sufficient.

## Control Signals For Security Review

- Boundary separation: storage package centralizes local persistence operations, simplifying audit scope.
- Atomic persistence available: WriteFileAtomically reduces partial-write risk for critical state.
- Permission control available: Chmod utility enables restricted modes for secrets and executable scripts.
- DB durability and contention controls: SQLite WAL mode and busy timeout are configured through opener utilities.
- Error context wrapping: most storage wrappers include operation-specific context in error paths.

## Known Gaps And Follow-Ups

| Gap | Why It Matters | Follow-Up |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Duplicate query paths for review sessions exist across storage files | Duplicate logic can drift and confuse auditors | Identify canonical path and deprecate duplicate wrapper set |
| Explicit schema migration workflow for review DB is not documented in this package | Harder to reason about schema evolution controls | Schema version marker note is now present; next step is a migration policy reference in docs |
| Lock metadata read path is documented, lock enforcement semantics are not explicit here | Concurrency guarantees for update flow may be unclear | Document enforcement owner and decision path in update docs |
| Some cleanup calls intentionally ignore non-critical errors | May reduce forensic clarity in uninstall/cleanup incidents | Document which cleanup failures are intentionally non-fatal |

## Review Cadence

- Update this file when any function is added/removed/renamed in the storage package.
- Re-evaluate severity when data sensitivity changes or when operation side effects change.
- Security review trigger: any new High operation or any change touching credentials, permissions, deletion scope, or DB mutation behavior.
